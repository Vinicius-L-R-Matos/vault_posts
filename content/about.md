# About Me

![[Vinicius_Matos.png|profile]]

Hi! I'm Matos, a brazilian data science enthusiast passionate about turning complex data into clear insights. With a strong background in programming, statistics, and machine learning, I enjoy solving real-world problems through data-driven solutions.

I’ve worked on a variety of projects since 2022 across analytics, automation, predictive modeling, automations and some LLM and SLM meaningfull use cases.

My focus is not just on building accurate models, but also on delivering value through meaningful interpretation and elegant visualizations.

This blog is my space to share knowledge, ideas, and experiments in data science, Python, machine learning, and beyond. Whether you're a beginner or a fellow data explorer, I hope you find something valuable here.


Let’s build some smarter solutions together!
