# Projects
Here is a list of open projects I’ve been working on:
### [Building a Blog System Using Obsidian](https://matosdatascience.com/posts/building-a-blog-system-using-obsidian/)
Turn your ideias in to blog posts in instants!
### Running a Local AI to Interact with Your Vault
Talk to your obsidian
### An Obsidian IDE for Python
Tired of the same old IDE? Why not build your one instead?
### Run a Powerful Offline AI Model from a USB Stick (Windows Guide)
An free and uncensored 7b model that work private and off line

Stay tuned — more projects are on the way!
