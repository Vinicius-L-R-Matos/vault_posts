The content here is automatically published to a Hostinger-hosted website, [Matos Data Science](https://matosdatascience.com/), allowing me to share research notes, projects, and insights with the community. The repository contains curated markdown files and related resources that reflect my ongoing work in data science, machine learning, and programming.
