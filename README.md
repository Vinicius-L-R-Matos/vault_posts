# README: vault_posts
*A public branch of my local Obsidian Vault, automatically syncing selected content to a Hostinger-hosted domain to share my work with the world.*

## 📌 About
This repository is a branch of my personal Obsidian Vault, which I manage locally. The content here is automatically published to a Hostinger-hosted website, [Matos Data Science](https://matosdatascience.com/), allowing me to share research notes, projects, and insights with the community. The repository contains curated markdown files and related resources that reflect my ongoing work in data science, machine learning, and programming.
